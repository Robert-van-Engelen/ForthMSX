The ForthMSX project and [Forth500](https://github.com/Robert-van-Engelen/Forth500)
[Forth850](https://github.com/Robert-van-Engelen/Forth850) benefit from the
work done by many others to offer inspiration, but the system does not include
licensed code of the following implementations or any other implementation not
listed here.  Some parts of ForthMSX are derived from freely available Forth
